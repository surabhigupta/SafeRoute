SafeRoute - Hackathon Project
=========

@Stanford India Association Hackathon

The purpose of this app is to use crowd-sourced data about about criminal incidents such as sexual assault to make travel safer. This is accomplished by providing routes that avoid areas with high incidence rates (which in turn, may be correlated with poor lighting, etc).
